# ABWaylineTest
Simple Android-app to show distance to AB-wayline

This basically cuts the planet in half by a plane defined by A and B points and the planet's center. 
Distance to AB-wayline is shown as a distance to this plane so it differs more from the real (great circle)
distance the farther from the line you get.

This app was written just to be able to follow/find a boundary line between two boundary markers
(typically using a RTK GNSS). In this use the difference between great circle/distance to plane doesn't really matter.

UI is kind of just thrown together and there are leftover debug infos and such.

This is more like a backup of this personal test project. But if someone finds this useful, feel free to do anything with it.
